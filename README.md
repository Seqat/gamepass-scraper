# GamePass-Scraper

## What is GamePass-Scraper?

GamePass-Scrapper is a simple scrapper for taking Xbox Game Pass for PC game list from a website called gamepasscounter.com and putting it into a CSV file. It is just a simple scraper for my training purposes to learn the basics of web scraping with Python. There is no warranty or guarantee that it will work for you. It is not meant to be used for anything else.
